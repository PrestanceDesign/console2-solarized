# [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme, ported to [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/).

## Installing

Replace your `console.xml` file's `<colors>` node with the one from this project's `console.xml`. You can typically find your Console2's config in `~/AppData/Roaming/Console`.

## License

Its free, as in speech and beer. If it breaks, feel free to keep both parts.
